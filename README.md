# Attacks on WLAN

This project focuses on assessing the security of wireless networks by simulating common real-world attacks and identifying critical vulnerabilities in WLAN infrastructures.


## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview

The goal of this project was to uncover vulnerabilities in wireless networks and highlight the importance of robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

We explored and implemented the following attack techniques:

- **DNS Spoofing**  
Redirecting traffic by corrupting the DNS cache and pointing users to malicious destinations.

- **Wi-Fi Password Cracking**  
Using tools like Aircrack-ng to capture and crack WPA/WPA2 passwords.

- **Rogue Access Point Creation**  
Setting up fake access points to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and capture sensitive data.

- **Wi-Fi Jamming**  
Disrupting wireless communication by sending continuous deauthentication or interference packets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- Aircrack-ng
- Bettercap
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux

## üîç Outcomes

- Identified critical vulnerabilities in WLAN environments.
- Developed recommendations to improve wireless security, such as:
  - Enabling WPA3 encryption.
  - Implementing secure authentication protocols.
  - Segmenting wireless networks.
  - Regularly monitoring for rogue access points.

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Importance of securing wireless networks against common attack vectors.
- Hands-on experience with offensive security tools.
- Improved understanding of mitigation strategies for wireless threats.
